            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Dedication,</hi> To the Memory of Dear Eliza.</head>
            <p>THeſe Mournful Lines <hi>(my dear Eliza)</hi> were Writ o'er thy Grave (whileſt I was a <hi>Widower</hi>) and are now <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> to thy Pious <hi>Name,</hi> as a <hi>Memorial</hi> of our Conſtant Love. As for the—<hi>Eſſay</hi>— Annex'd, 'twas Writ preſently after thy Death, to mitigate my <hi>Sorrow</hi> for it, which is in ſome part <hi>Juſtified</hi> by the greatneſs of my Loſs, in being ſeparated, after ſo long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, from ſo kind a Wife. 'Tis no wonder that <hi>Phil.</hi> who Lov'd thee ſo much on Earth, ſhou'd attempt to Prove,
<q rend="margQuotes">He ſhall know thee again in Heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We are taught by the Holy Scriptures, <hi>That Love is ſtrong as Death;</hi> and that the Love of Chriſt to his Church, who gave Himſelf to the Death for her, is propoſed to <hi>Chriſtian Husbands</hi> as a Pattern of Love to their Wives.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199208:3"/> He lov'd his Church with an Everlaſting love, and ſo muſt I thy <hi>Memory,</hi> my Deareſt, while I continue to <hi>be, and think.</hi> It is no more poſſible to <hi>rob my Soul of thine Idea, than to deprive it of its Immortality;</hi> Death, which hath made a Separation betwixt our Bodies, is not able to Separate our Souls; thou waſt lovely and pleaſant to me in thy <hi>Life,</hi> and therefore can'ſt not be divided from me by thy <hi>Death;</hi> though the unſpeakable Joys where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou art now made Partaker, make thee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of me, becauſe thou art wholly taken up with <hi>Tranſports of Heavenly Love.</hi> If it were otherwiſe, I am ſure thy Happineſs could not be compleat 'till <hi>thy other half were alſo Tranſported into Heaven.</hi> I don't envy thee, though I groan alſo to be delivered from this Earthly Tabernacle, which hinders me from partaking of Heavenly Society with thee, which if I may make bold to ſay ſo, <hi>makes Heaven it ſelf the more deſirable to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for that, I muſt ſtay 'till the Decree of the Eternal take effect, and therefore ſeeing <hi>thy place here on Earth knows thee no more,</hi> that I can no more enjoy ſweet Communion with thee, <hi>'till we meet in Heaven.</hi> I have no other Relief at preſent, but to <hi>refreſh and torment</hi> my ſelf at the ſame time with the <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thy Virtues.</hi> Did Religion allow any Sacrifice to thy Shrine, or Adoration at thy Tomb, my head-ſtrong Affection would puſh me on to it; but that is<note n="(a)" place="margin">We are ſure there is neither Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Promiſe in all the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to make our Application to the <hi>Saints departed.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi>'s <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi> p. <hi>79.</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199208:3"/> 
               <hi>Meet-help,</hi> as I found thee always to be, till the arrival of that fatal Moment which made the <hi>cruel Separation.</hi> I call it ſo, as 'twas my frequent Wiſh, we might expire in each others Arms, that we might imitate herein the Mayor of <hi>Litomentias</hi>'s Daughter; who leaping into the River where her Husband was drown'd, ſhe claſped him about the Middle, and <hi>expires with him in her Arms;</hi> and what is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, they were found the next day <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing one another.</hi> The ſame Inſtance we have in the <hi>Captain</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> who were laſt Week caſt away in the <hi>Tilt-boat;</hi> for they were taken up ſo cloſely <hi>Lock'd in each others Arms,</hi> that 'twas hard to part them. Thus had Heaven ſeen it meet, that as we were <hi>Vnited</hi> in our Life, we ſhou'd not have been <hi>Divided</hi> in our Death; it would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd the Arrow of Mortality to me, and made that <hi>King of Terrors a King of Pleaſures.</hi> But thou waſt Riper for Everlaſting Joy, and therefore ſooner tranſported thither, and <hi>I muſt not repine.</hi> For thoſe whom <hi>God hath joyn'd together, no Man muſt put aſunder;</hi> yet when he that made the Union makes the Separation, there's no ſaying <hi>What doeſt Thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the Holy Spirit which hath taught us, that the <hi>Righteous ſhall be had in Everlaſting Remembrance,</hi> will not be offended if I perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate thy Memory to my ſelf, and carry the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199208:4"/> 
               <hi>Idea of thy Vertues</hi> conſtantly in my Mind, that I may do nothing unworthy of my <hi>better half,</hi> which is in Glory, as I have read was the Practiſe of a certain Great Perſon, who conſtantly carried his <hi>Father's Picture</hi> about him, that he might not do any thing unworthy of ſuch a Progenitor. I ſhall imitate this Example, by always carrying this <hi>Eſſay in my Pocket,</hi> to Re-mind me daily of that Pattern you ſet me, and as a <hi>Memento</hi> I ſhall ſee thee again, which I can't but paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as <hi>I enjoy'd both Worlds in Dear Eliza;</hi> and were I to wed again (and this I ſpeak after Ten Years Tryal) I'd preferr thy ſelf to the Richeſt Nymph <hi>(God ſaw thee moſt</hi>

Thus you find <hi>(if you Saints above know what's done below)</hi> how conſtant my Love is, and <hi>that even in Death it ſelf you can die but half, whilſt I am preſerved.</hi> And tho you're gone to Heaven before me, yet I hope I ſhall ſpeedily follow after

                  <p>I received <hi>(my Deareſt)</hi> thy obliging Letter, and thankfully own, that tho God has exerciſed me with a <hi>long and languiſhing Sickneſs, and my Grave lies in view,</hi> yet he hath dealt tenderly with me; ſo that I find by Experience no Compaſſions are like thoſe of a God. 'Tis true, I have ſcarce Strength to anſwer your Letter; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you deſire a few Lines, to keep as a <hi>Memorial of our Conſtant Love,</hi> I'll attempt

               <p>As for my <hi>Carriage to my Husband,</hi> I ſhall reckon it both Prudence and my Duty, to <hi>ſtudy his Humour when we firſt come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and then to do all I can without ſinning to pleaſe and oblige him, to <hi>obey him in all things that are not contrary to the Commands of God.</hi> — If I ſhould light on one that is <hi>wicked,</hi> I'll endeavour what I can by my Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to <hi>engage his Affections throughly to me, and then to make uſe of that tye to engage him to God, and by my Christian Carriage to try what can be done to win him over to Chriſt by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of him with all Meekneſs, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging my great Love to him, and that 'tis Love that makes me do it, and my deſire of his being happy for ever.</hi> I ſhall reckon it my Duty, if I have a good Man, to be <hi>willing to learn of him,</hi> and to do what we can to engage each other more entirely to God, to make uſe of our Love to one another, to inflame our Souls with Love to Chriſt. — Being convinced from <hi>Scripture and Reaſon</hi> that 'tis my Duty to give to the Poor, I now reſolve when I <hi>marry</hi> to give according to my ability.

Thou mad'ſt Conſcience of taking care, that the Incumbrances of this World ſhould not make thee neglect the weighty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199208:13"/> Duties relating to the other. Thy Kindneſs to other Relations was not diminiſhed by a fond Affection to me at firſt, as is uſual with other <hi>Young Brides,</hi> becauſe thou didſt look upon due kindneſs to thy Relations as an act of Duty to thy Maker, and their <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Favours</hi> to me did mightily heighten your eſteem for them.</p>
               <p>Thy <hi>Cloſet</hi> was the Withdrawing-room wherein thou didſt moſt delight, becauſe there thou didſt entertain Communion with Heaven; and many times when thou <hi>retiredſt thither in ſadneſs,</hi> thou cameſt out again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But what the knowledge is of our Souls, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and glorified, <hi>we ſhall then know when ours come to be ſuch:</hi> In the mean time, we can much leſs know their thoughts, then they can know ours: Sure we are, they do not know in ſuch manner as they did, when they were in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms; by the help of <hi>Senſes and Phantaſms, by

               <p>But now, whether the Soul, in a ſtate of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acts independently of Matter, purely by the ſtrength of her own Powers, or whether in order to the better knowing her ſelf and other beings, the makes uſe of a <hi>Body of Air ſhaped out into ſuch Limbs and Sences, as ſhe hath occaſional Employment for;</hi> Whether or no the want of her old Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſupplyed this way, is uncertain.

But we cannot know theſe things, <hi>Till we are ſtrip'd into Naked Spirits, and ſet a ſhore on the other inviſible World.</hi> Yet this we know at preſent, that when our Souls are elevated to a condition ſuitable to the Bleſſed Angels, ſo they <hi>know like them;</hi> Though not by the means of a Natural Knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they, yet by that <hi>Supernatural Light of Intimation,</hi> which they receive by their glorified Eſtate: Whether by virtue of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Illumination, <hi>They know the particular occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which we meet with here below, he were bold thas would determine.</hi> (Or if they do I'm ſure <hi>Eliza</hi> but her Love will tell you the reſt) only this we may confidently affirm, that they do clearly know

               <p>Our Creed moreover calls upon us to believe a <hi>Communion of Saints;</hi> which if it be a matter of our Faith here, it muſt be an object of our Knowledge hereafter; if we muſt believe that there are ſome who ſincerely communicate with us in the Faith in this Life, then we ſhall hereafter clearly know who were our Fellow-Members in that Communion; and as Faith it ſelf ſhall be done away by Evidence, ſo ſhall that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is here by Faith, be hereafter perfected by that Communion which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Object. 1. <hi>But it may be ſaid, that in our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion unto God ſhall be ſupplied all imaginable Contents; and that the Souls of the Bleſſed ſhall be held in ſo great Admiration, as that they cannot admit the mixture of any ſecond or leſs Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Though this Opinion ſeems ſpecious, and agreeable to Reaſon, yet we muſt conſider, that as in the Divine Nature we admit no uſeleſs Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, ſo likewiſe in the Humane, we muſt either ſay it hath no aptneſs Eternally to deſire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the good of another, (which a ſociable Nature inwardly abhorreth) or elſe we muſt allow it an Object whereon to practice its endleſs Love and Joy. This Love we conceive ſhall be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that Deſire which was begun on Earth,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:199208:52"/> but always mixt with Fear and Jealouſie, and this Joy we believe ſhall ſucceed in the place of that Condolency and Compaſſion, which on Earth we ſuſtained one for another. This Love therefore, and this Joy, muſt have ſuch an Object, as was once the ſubject of our Fear and Compaſſion, which cannot be either God or Angels, but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only, of the ſame Nature and Condition with us.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>But it may be feared that our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of one another, and our mutual delight in each other, may beget ſome Interruptions in our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This fear, I think, will vaniſh, ſo ſoon as we conſider, that it is the ſame Beauty which we behold in God, and love in the Creature, though of a different ſplendor; and as the Stars, the Air, and Water, by their borrowed Lights do raiſe us to behold the Sun, the Fountain of all that Light; ſo whereſoever the Rays of Glory are caſt (whether on Angels or Men) we cannot but behold God ſhining on each Nature, and confeſs Him to be All in All. Moreover, it is not a glance, but a fixing on the Creature (which in that ſtate is not to be feared) can endanger our Happineſs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neither God nor Angels are truly Bleſſed; for the Divinity of former Ages would perſuade us, That God as it were cometh daily out of Himſelf to <hi>behold his own Image in the Angels,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels look upon the ſame Reſemblance as caſt from them, and reflected by the Soul; but neither God, nor Angels are ſo raviſhed with thoſe <hi>dimmer Beauties,</hi> as to dwell upon them, but do ſuddenly return back to the Fountain, God to Himſelf, and the Angels unto God.</p>
               <p>Thus have I Anſwered two of the Objections, <hi>Againſt knowing our Friends in Heaven,</hi> and have proved we ſhall know 'em if we get thither, ſince <hi>Heaven</hi> is a Place where ſince nothing requiſite

                  <hi>To this I Anſwer, Firſt, as to the Angels,</hi>— What if thou knoweſt not one Angel in all the Heavens? Is it not enough (ſays a late Writer) <hi>That many of 'em may know thee?</hi> —But how ſhall I know that— <hi>How?</hi> — Thou haſt been their ſpecial Charge ever ſince thou waſt born to Jeſus Chriſt— Are they not all Miniſtring Spirits to all them that are Heirs of Glory?— How kindly did an <hi>Angel Comfort Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the other <hi>Mary,</hi> when they early came to viſit the Holy Sepulchre of our Lord? How well did he know their Perſons and their buſineſs, when he ſaid,— <hi>Fear not, I know that ye ſeek Jeſus, which was Crucified; he is not here, for he is Riſen, as he ſaid, come ſee the place where the Lord lay, and go quickly and tell his Diſciples that he is Riſen from the Dead, and behold he goeth before you into Galilee, there ſhall ye ſee him,</hi> Mat. 28.5. <hi>So as I have told you</hi>— what Diſcourſe could be more kind, friendly, and famliar.</p>
               <p>So that the Miniſtration of Angels is certain, but the manner how, is the Knot to be untied. 'Twas gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believ'd by the Antient Philoſophers, That not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:199208:53"/> only Kingdoms had their Tutelary Guardians, but that every Perſon had his particular Genius or Good Angel to Protect and Admoniſh him by Dreams, Viſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We read that <hi>Origen, Hierome, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Empedocles</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> were alſo of this Opinion; and the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that Inſtance of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Deliverance out of Priſon; who retreating to his Friend's Houſe, the unexpectedneſs of his Eſcape made 'em be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it could not be <hi>Peter, but his Angel.</hi> We are not without Examples of the Friendly Offices of Angels.

And therefore, to queſtion that ours ſhall be ſo too, is but a dangerous Scrupuloſity, ſince it deprives us of <hi>one of the Means,</hi> by which we may know our Friends again, which I eſteem one of the greateſt Comforts (next to thoſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſulting from the Viſion of God himſelf) we can meet with in Heaven, and which is mention'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (as I hinted before) as one of the beſt Remedies againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Sorrow for the Death of Friends.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.13, 14, 18.</note> — <hi>I wou'd not have you</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not even as others which have no hope; for if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him, wherefore comfort ye one another with theſe Words.</hi>

               <p>Now if our Friends were to riſe in ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed manner, as not to be known again by us, this kind of Conſolation wou'd be Impertinent and Vain; — Neither let the many Cavils <hi>(my dear

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:199208:60"/> Conceit. However, if I am askt for my Authorities, I Anſwer, what appears reaſonable wants no other Recommendation than being ſo; and as to what appears over ſtrange, <hi>let Ignotus conſider,</hi> that <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> had never been improved had it not been for <hi>New-Opinions,</hi> which afterwards were rectified by abler Pens, and ſo the Firſt Notions were loſt and nameleſs, under new Superſtructures, but ſuch a Fate (to uſe the Words of a late Author) <hi>is too Agreeable for my Judgement to repine at, or my Vanity to hope for.</hi> But — that there's a — <hi>difference of Sex in Souls, and will be Male and Female in Heaven, (tho the Notion's new)</hi> yet I never doubted it, and hope to make it plain before we part,</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But you'l ſay, when the Holy Spirit ſpeaks of ſeparated Souls that are gathered up into Heaven, he does not ſpeak — of</hi> Male or Female, <hi>but only of Souls without diſtinguiſhing either kind, or Sex, — And further, that 'tis ſaid</hi> there is no Marrying in Heaven, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.25. And that in Jeſus Chriſt there is neither Male nor Female, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. <hi>VVhich it directly contrary to the</hi> diſtinction of Sex in Souls. — <hi>For if Sex be only for the ſake of Marriage, where there is no Marriage, there is no need of</hi> Diſtinct-Sex, Then why that in Heaven which there's no need of? <hi>All that's of the Eſſence of a Man will undoubtedly he there,</hi> and that's a Rational Soul united to an Organiz'd Body; <hi>but what Organs will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then, we can't tell, however theſe cannot.

Perhaps you'l alſo Object the</hi> Words of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who ſays, — The Soul is not diſtinguiſhed into Sexes. <hi>And that of St.</hi> Cyril, <hi>who liv'd before him, who alſo ſays,</hi> — The Souls of Men and Women are abſolutely alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor is there any parts of their Bodies, wherein there is any difference to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>

                  <hi>To this I Anſwer,</hi> — That Souls may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh't into <hi>Male and Female,</hi> (notwithſtanding theſe Objections) ſince 'tis a Common ſaying — <hi>The Soul of a Man, and the Soul of a Woman.</hi> — And moreover, becauſe it is generally believed, and no leſs ſenſibly acknowledged, that they have each their particular Character, — the Soul <hi>(and conſequently the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding)</hi> of the one is Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Conſtant, that of the other Light, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and Changable, (<hi>Eliza, Cloris, Daphne, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho, Anonyma, Ariadne,</hi> your Dear <hi>Dorinda,</hi> and my <hi>SHE-Angel,</hi> are all the exceptions I know of from this Rule) — The Soul of one takes a pride in being Grave, and ſpeaking little; the other talks much, and cannot forbear <hi>twatling upon every thing</hi> — and which is yet more to the purpoſe, does not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay, — That the <hi>Sons of God</hi> (whom ſeveral of the Fathers of the Church have Expounded to be Angels) <hi>Fell in Love with the Daughters of Men?</hi> And if there be a Sex mark'd out for Love in Angels, we need not ſcruple to go a little farther, and ſay that <hi>there is alſo a Sex in Souls.</hi> To this we may likewiſe add certain Experſſions of thoſe great Men, who are frequently Cited by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Writings, — I mean <hi>Homer,</hi> who gives the <hi>Greeks</hi> the Appellation of— <hi>She Achaeans,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> who calls the <hi>Trojans — She-Phrygians;</hi> — and <hi>Cicero,</hi> who Reports that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was treated at <hi>Rome</hi> with the Title of <hi>Madam,</hi> — whence could proceed this Cuſtome
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:199208:61"/> of giving Men the Epithites of Women, but only becauſe, that 'tho they had the Bodies of Men they had the <hi>Souls — of — Women:</hi> — And I might mention the <hi>Apparitions of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> in the ſame <hi>Shape and Sex,</hi> they formerly lived, is in no contemplible proof of this Aſſertion. <hi>But you'l ſay perhaps — Souls are not furniſht with Organs that make this distinction between 'em, and that a Spirit cannot become Viſible.</hi>

               <p>Thus having <hi>Anſwered</hi> ſome of the Arguments denying <hi>There's a Sex in Souls</hi> — I ſhall next conſider the <hi>Scripture Paſſages</hi> brought againſt this Opinion, and ſhall firſt begin with that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying of Chriſt, that He is neither <hi>Male nor Female</hi>—I ſhall next conſider that other Text which ſays,— <hi>There is no Marrying in Heaven</hi>— Theſe Texts being brought as the main Arguments to prove—<hi>There's no difference of Sex in Souls,</hi> and that we ſhan't be known in Heaven by that diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying — That Chriſt is neither <hi>Male nor Female</hi> — To this I Anſwer, he ſpeaks of <hi>the whole Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or only of his Body, — or only of his Soul — He does not ſpeak of his Body, for certain it is — That as to his Body He was of the <hi>Maſculine Sex</hi>— If he ſpeaks of his Soul, that makes for my Opinion: For in ſaying that of the Soul of Chriſt, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:199208:62"/> intended to ſay ſomething extraordinary of Him, which was not common to Him with the reſt of Men — and to the end that that ſhou'd be, 'tis requiſite that the Souls of all other Men ſhou'd be —<hi>individually Male and Female</hi> — elſe it had been of no Importance to ſay what he ſays of Chriſt —The Apoſtle had told us <hi>nothing of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> in that particular —But to give you a better Interpretation of the thing, 'tis the Opinion of a Learned Man, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant the <hi>whole Jeſus Chriſt</hi>—That is to ſay, that his Perſon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of two Natures—<hi>Divine and Humane</hi>— is Singular, and has nothing of Similitude with other Bodies, <hi>except ſome Organs that make the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Sex,</hi> ſo as to be enclin'd to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of others of the ſame <hi>double Nature and Order</hi>— So that this makes nothing againſt my Opinion, but much for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as to that other Text,</hi> which ſays — <hi>That in Heaven there is neither Marrying, nor giving in Marriage</hi>— it directly proves my Aſſertion— For Virginity and Celibacy are ſo far from deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sex, that they ſuppoſe it— Thus Chriſt did not intend to ſay—That there wou'd be <hi>no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Sexes in Heaven</hi>—And if he does not Aſſert this, we are left at liberty to believe there will, for the Reaſons I have here given, which plainly prove, that glorified Bodies ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Heaven, the Bodies of <hi>Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Saints,</hi> and (that) at preſent, there are no other than <hi>Male and Female Souls</hi> in that bleſſed Place, except it be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. I might next conſider the Words of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> who ſay, all <hi>Souls are alike,</hi> but their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion being meer Conjecture, without any further Proof, I ſhall paſs it by in Silence.</p>
               <p>Thus having largely proved, That there's <hi>a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Sex in Souls</hi>— and conſequently— <hi>That we ſhall know one another in Heaven,</hi> by the diſtinction of Male and Female — And 'tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſome that we ſhall know one another by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:199208:63"/> Voice; which brings me in the <hi>laſt place,</hi> to Treat of the <hi>Diſcourſe and Language of the Saints in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Firſt, as to what the Diſcourſe will be in Heaven, <hi>I won't tell ye, for indeed I can't,</hi> but will give ſome imperfect Gueſſes at it. Doubtleſs, we ſhall then Diſcourſe over the <hi>whole Buſineſs of our Redemption,</hi> of the <hi>Wiſdom, Patience and Mercy</hi> of God, in ſending Chriſt to Save us— We have ſome <hi>little Glimpſe</hi> of this in <hi>Chriſt's Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when the Scripture tells us when the Saints were ſent from Heaven to Diſcourſe with Chriſt, <hi>there talked with him Moſes and Elias, who appeared to Him in Glory,</hi> then they ſpake of the Death of Chriſt, what a Price He was to pay to Divine Juſtice for Man's Sins, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.30, 31. As Chriſt's Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration gives us ſome little Glimpſe of our <hi>Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration</hi> in Glory, ſo their <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> ſhews ſomething what we ſhall have in Glory — The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> heard <hi>wordleſs Words,</hi> Words in Heaven that cou'd not be <hi>ſpoke over again</hi> upon Earth— In the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> we have mention of the Bleſſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. They ſung a new Song, ſaying, <hi>Thou art worthy to take the Book,</hi> &amp;c.— We have frequent accounts of the Saints Glorifying God by their Speech, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I beheld a great Multitude, that no Man cou'd number, crying Salvation, Honour and Power unto God, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever.</hi> And 11th. <hi>Rev.</hi> The Twenty Four Elders that ſate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, fell on theit Faces and worſhipped God. 12th. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. <hi>I heard a great Voice in Heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Now is come Salvation, Strength, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God</hi>— 'Tis true, variety of Tongues ſhall then ceaſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.

               <p>But Methinks I hear ſome Diſconſolate Widower ſaying, <hi>I am now fully ſatisfied we ſhall know our Friends in Heaven; but having lately loſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Wife ('tis my own Caſe) I deſire to know if I get to Heaven, whether I ſhall have a greater Love to her than to the reſt of the Glorified Saints, notwithſtanding all Carnal Love ſhall be quite baniſht in that State; you know</hi> Phil.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">For if the Condition of Man be changed by Death into a better, how can it be, he being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that he ſhould have leſs Love, and Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Charity in him, than he had while he liv'd in the World? And if Memory be a Faculty of the Soul, (as has been prov'd) and <hi>Charity</hi> be alſo one of the notableſt Vertues that be in Man's Soul, the Soul being gone out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and more perfect than it was while it abode here below, ſhall it be thought to be alter'd in the <hi>Faculty of her Memory?</hi> Or elſe ſhall we imagine her to be void of her <hi>Vertue of Charity?</hi>

To mention one; <hi>Caeſar Baronius</hi> in his Annals, mentions an entire Friendſhip betwixt one <hi>Michael Mercatus,</hi> and <hi>Marſilius Ficinus,</hi> and this Friendſhip was the ſtronger betwixt them, by reaſon of a mutual Agreement in their Studies, and an addictedneſs to the Doctrines of <hi>Plato.</hi> It fell out that theſe two Diſcourſing together <hi>(as they uſed)</hi> of the <hi>State of Man after Death,</hi> according to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinions, (there is Extant a Learned Epiſtle of <hi>Marſilius,</hi> to <hi>Michael Mercatus</hi> upon the ſame Subject,) but when their Diſputation and Diſcourſe was drawn out ſomething long, they ſhut it up with this firm Agreement, that whichſoever of them two ſhould firſt depart out of this Life, <hi>(if it might be)</hi> ſhould aſcertain the Survivor, <hi>of the State of the other Life, and whether the Soul be Immortal or not:</hi> this Agreement being made, and mutualy ſworn unto, they departed. In a ſhort time, it fell out, that while <hi>Michael Mercatus</hi> was one Morning early at his Study, upon the ſudden he heard the noiſe of an Horſe upon the Gallop, then ſtopping at his Door, withal he heard the Voice of <hi>Marſilius his Friend,</hi> crying to him, <hi>Oh Michael, Oh Michael, thoſe things are true, they are true; Michael</hi> wondering to hear his Frien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:199208:67"/> Poor, and bid him take it, but give him <hi>a Bill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand, that Chriſt ſhould re-pay it him in another World. Syneſius</hi> took the Money for the Poor, and gave him, under his hand, ſuch a Bill as he deſired — Not long after the Philoſopher, being near to Death, commanded his Sons, that when they buried him, they ſhould put <hi>Syneſius Bill</hi> in his Hand in the Grave, which they did. And the third Day after, the Philoſopher ſeemed to appear to <hi>Syneſius</hi> in the Night, and ſaid to him, <hi>Come to my Sepulchre where I lye, and take thy Bill, for I have Received the Debt, and am ſatisfied, which for thy Aſſurance I have Subſcribed with my own Hand.</hi> The Biſhop knew not that the Bill was buried with him, but ſent to his Sons, who told him all, and taking them, and the chief Men of the City, he went to the Grave, and found the Paper in the hands of the Corps thus Subſcribed:</p>

                  <hi>As to theſe Apparitions of the Dead</hi>—Although it cannot be denied, but in ſome grand and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Caſes, as the Reſurrection of thoſe dead which appeared upon our Saviour's <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> and the Apparition of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> at the Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration: And in ſome other Caſes, as many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be reckon'd up: The Departed may Converſe with us, or appear, but perhaps ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Apparitions are not the Souls of the Dead, but

It is ſuppoſed, No: For after the Surprize is over, thoſe Heats allayed, which were at firſt ſtirred up in him, he will quickly invent Excuſes and Arguments, why he ſhould not effect that Reformation he has ſo much Averſion from.— For <hi>Firſt,</hi> Tho he was deeply touched at firſt, and all his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in ſuch a Conſternation, that he was ſcarce himſelf, yet being recover'd from the Fright, the Inclination he has to Sin will put him <hi>upon Doubt and Scrutiny, and to queſtion the Reality of the thing.</hi> He knows not but the Viſion was only the Effect of <hi>Melancholy, and a Drooping Mind,</hi> or the Imagination of a diſtemper'd Brain.

It is eaſie for a Man, who is willing not to believe any thing of this Nature, to bring himſelf to ſuch an Opinion, to evade and ſhift off the Thoughts of it, that they might not diſturb and trouble him in his Wickedneſſes. But then he is much more encouraged, when he tells his idle and wanton Companions the Relation, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hearing it, will not forbear <hi>jeſting him out of the Conceit;</hi> nor will they want Arguments to

But ſuppoſing it is no Fraud, <hi>but indeed a Spirit,</hi> yet he knows not whether it be his Friend; if he was convinced of this, he would credit his Relation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately change upon it.

But ſince none that he knows of are thus handled, he has no reaſon to credit the Relation of the Spirit. <hi>If ſuch means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction were rational and powerful, doubtleſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would be afforded them as well as he; but ſince he hears nor knows of none, he ſhall not take things upon truſt, but continue unperſwaded as he is.</hi> Thus we ſee how Men, who withſtand
